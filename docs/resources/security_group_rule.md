# outscale_security_group_rule Resource

Manages a security group rule.

For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Security-Group-Rules.html).  
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-securitygrouprule).

## Example Usage

### Required resources

```hcl
resource "outscale_security_group" "security_group01" {
	description         = "Terraform target security group for SG rule from IP and SG"
	security_group_name = "terraform-security-group-test-01"
}

resource "outscale_security_group" "security_group02" {
	description         = "Terraform source security group for SG rule from SG"
	security_group_name = "terraform-security-group-test-02"
}
```

### Set an inbound rule from an IP range

```hcl
resource "outscale_security_group_rule" "security_group_rule01" {
	flow              = "Inbound"
	security_group_id = outscale_security_group.security_group01.security_group_id
	from_port_range   = "80"
	to_port_range     = "80"
	ip_protocol       = "tcp"
	ip_range          = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

### Set an inbound rule from another security group

```hcl
resource "outscale_security_group_rule" "security_group_rule02" {
	flow              = "Inbound"
	security_group_id = outscale_security_group.security_group01.security_group_id
	rules {
		from_port_range = "22"
		to_port_range   = "22"
		ip_protocol     = "tcp"
		security_groups_members {
			account_id          = "012345678910"
			security_group_name = "terraform-security-group-test-02"
		}
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `flow` - (Required) The direction of the flow: `Inbound` or `Outbound`. You can specify `Outbound` for Nets only.
* `from_port_range` - (Optional) The beginning of the port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number. If you specify this parameter, you cannot specify the `rules` parameter and its subparameters.
* `ip_protocol` - (Optional) The IP protocol name (`tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, or `-1` for all protocols). By default, `-1`. In a Net, this can also be an IP protocol number. For more information, see the [IANA.org website](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml). If you specify this parameter, you cannot specify the `rules` parameter and its subparameters.
* `ip_range` - (Optional) The IP range for the security group rule, in CIDR notation (for example, 10.0.0.0/16). If you specify this parameter, you cannot specify the `rules` parameter and its subparameters.
* `rules` - (Optional) Information about the security group rule to create. If you specify this parent parameter and its subparameters, you cannot specify the following parent parameters: `from_port_range`, `ip_protocol`, `ip_range`, and `to_port_range`.
    * `from_port_range` - (Optional) The beginning of the port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.
    * `ip_protocol` - (Optional) The IP protocol name (`tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, or `-1` for all protocols). By default, `-1`. In a Net, this can also be an IP protocol number. For more information, see the [IANA.org website](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml).
    * `ip_ranges` - (Optional) One or more IP ranges for the security group rules, in CIDR notation (for example, `10.0.0.0/16`).
    * `security_groups_members` - (Optional) Information about one or more source or destination security groups.
        * `account_id` - (Optional) The account ID that owns the source or destination security group.
        * `security_group_id` - (Required) The ID of a source or destination security group that you want to link to the security group of the rule.
        * `security_group_name` - (Optional) (Public Cloud only) The name of a source or destination security group that you want to link to the security group of the rule.
    * `service_ids` - (Optional) One or more service IDs to allow traffic from a Net to access the corresponding OUTSCALE services. For more information, see [ReadNetAccessPointServices](https://docs.outscale.com/api#readnetaccesspointservices).
    * `to_port_range` - (Optional) The end of the port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code number.
* `security_group_account_id_to_link` - (Optional) The account ID that owns the source or destination security group specified in the `security_group_name_to_link` parameter.
* `security_group_id` - (Required) The ID of the security group for which you want to create a rule.
* `security_group_name_to_link` - (Optional) The ID of a source or destination security group that you want to link to the security group of the rule.
* `to_port_range` - (Optional) The end of the port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code number. If you specify this parameter, you cannot specify the `rules` parameter and its subparameters.

## Import

A security group rule can be imported using the following format: `SecurityGroupId_Flow_IpProtocol_FromPortRange_ToPortRange_IpRange`.

For example:

```console

$ terraform import outscale_security_group_rule.ImportedRule sg-87654321_outbound_-1_-1_-1_10.0.0.0/16

```
~> **Note:** You can specify only one IP range at a time. To import a rule with several IP ranges, you need to have as many imports as there are IP ranges.
