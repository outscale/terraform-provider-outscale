# outscale_flexible_gpu Resource

Manages a flexible GPU.
For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Flexible-GPUs.html).
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-flexiblegpu).

## Example Usage

### Create a flexible GPU

```hcl
resource "outscale_flexible_gpu" "flexible_gpu01" {
  model_name             =  var.model_name
  generation             =  "v4"
  subregion_name         =  "${var.region}a"
  delete_on_vm_deletion  =  true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `delete_on_vm_deletion` - (Optional) If true, the fGPU is deleted when the VM is terminated.
* `generation` - (Optional) The processor generation that the fGPU must be compatible with. If not specified, the oldest possible processor generation is selected (as provided by [ReadFlexibleGpuCatalog](https://docs.outscale.com/api#readflexiblegpucatalog) for the specified model of fGPU).
* `model_name` - (Required) The model of fGPU you want to allocate. For more information, see [About Flexible GPUs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Flexible-GPUs.html).
* `subregion_name` - (Required) The Subregion in which you want to create the fGPU.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `delete_on_vm_deletion` - If true, the fGPU is deleted when the VM is terminated.
* `flexible_gpu_id` - The ID of the fGPU.
* `generation` - The compatible processor generation.
* `model_name` - The model of fGPU. For more information, see [About Flexible GPUs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Flexible-GPUs.html).
* `state` - The state of the fGPU (`allocated` \| `attaching` \| `attached` \| `detaching`).
* `subregion_name` - The Subregion where the fGPU is located.
* `vm_id` - The ID of the VM the fGPU is attached to, if any.

## Import

A flexible GPU can be imported using its ID. For example:

```console

$ terraform import outscale_flexible_gpu.imported_fgpu fgpu-12345678

```
