## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `allow_relink` - (Optional) If true, allows the public IP to be associated with the VM or NIC that you specify even if it is already associated with another VM or NIC. If false, prevents the public IP from being associated with the VM or NIC that you specify if it is already associated with another VM or NIC. (By default, true in the public Cloud, false in a Net.)
* `nic_id` - (Optional) (Net only) The ID of the NIC. This parameter is required if the VM has more than one NIC attached. Otherwise, you need to specify the `vm_id` parameter instead. You cannot specify both parameters at the same time.
