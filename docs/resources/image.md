# outscale_image Resource

Manages an image.

For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-OMIs.html).  
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-image).

## Example Usage

### Create an image

```hcl
resource "outscale_image" "image01" {
    image_name = "terraform-omi-create"
    vm_id      = var.vm_id
    no_reboot  = "true"
}
```

### Import an image
~> **Important** Make sure the manifest file is still valid.

```hcl
resource "outscale_image" "image02" {
    description   = "Terraform register OMI"
    image_name    = "terraform-omi-register"
    file_location = "<URL>"
}
```

### Copy an image

```hcl
resource "outscale_image" "image03" {
    description        = "Terraform copy OMI"
    image_name         = "terraform-omi-copy"
    source_image_id    = "ami-12345678"
    source_region_name = "eu-west-2"
}
```

### Create an image with a Block Storage Unit (BSU) volume

```hcl
resource "outscale_image" "image04" {
    image_name = "terraform-omi-bsu"
    block_device_mappings {
        device_name = "/dev/sda1" 
        bsu {
        snapshot_id           = "snap-12345678"
        volume_size           = "120"
        volume_type           = "io1"
        iops                  = 150
        delete_on_vm_deletion = "true"
        }
    }
    root_device_name = "/dev/sda1"
    description      = "Terraform OMI with BSU"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `architecture` - (Optional) **(when registering from a snapshot, or from a bucket without using a manifest file)** The architecture of the OMI (`i386` or `x86_64`).
* `block_device_mappings` - (Optional) **(when registering from a snapshot, or from a bucket without using a manifest file)** One or more block device mappings.
    * `bsu` - Information about the BSU volume to create.
        * `delete_on_vm_deletion` - (Optional) By default or if set to true, the volume is deleted when terminating the VM. If false, the volume is not deleted when terminating the VM.
        * `iops` - (Optional) The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). This parameter must be specified only if you create an `io1` volume. The maximum number of IOPS allowed for `io1` volumes is `13000` with a maximum performance ratio of 300 IOPS per gibibyte.
        * `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The ID of the snapshot used to create the volume.
        * `volume_size` - (Optional) The size of the volume, in gibibytes (GiB).<br />
If you specify a snapshot ID, the volume size must be at least equal to the snapshot size.<br />
If you specify a snapshot ID but no volume size, the volume is created with a size similar to the snapshot one.
        * `volume_type` - (Optional) The type of the volume (`standard` \| `io1` \| `gp2`). If not specified in the request, a `standard` volume is created.<br />
For more information about volume types, see [About Volumes > Volume Types and IOPS](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Volumes.html#_volume_types_and_iops).
    * `device_name` - (Optional) The device name for the volume. For a root device, you must use `/dev/sda1`. For other volumes, you must use `/dev/sdX`, `/dev/sdXX`, `/dev/xvdX`, or `/dev/xvdXX` (where the first `X` is a letter between `b` and `z`, and the second `X` is a letter between `a` and `z`).
    * `virtual_device_name` - (Optional) The name of the virtual device (`ephemeralN`).
* `description` - (Optional) A description for the new OMI.
* `file_location` - (Optional) **(when registering from a bucket by using a manifest file)** The pre-signed URL of the manifest file for the OMI you want to register. For more information, see [Configuring a Pre-signed URL](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Configuring-a-Pre-signed-URL.html) or [Managing Access to Your Buckets and Objects](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/Managing-Access-to-Your-Buckets-and-Objects.html).<br />
You can also specify the normal URL of the OMI if you have permission on the OOS bucket, without using the manifest file, but in that case, you need to manually specify through the other parameters all the information that would otherwise be read from the manifest file.
* `image_name` - (Optional) A unique name for the new OMI.<br />
Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, underscores (`_`), spaces (` `), parentheses (`()`), slashes (`/`), periods (`.`), or dashes (`-`).
* `no_reboot` - (Optional) **(when creating from a VM)** If false, the VM shuts down before creating the OMI and then reboots. If true, the VM does not.
* `product_codes` - (Optional) The product codes associated with the OMI.
* `root_device_name` - (Optional) **(when registering from a snapshot, or from a bucket without using a manifest file)** The name of the root device for the new OMI.
* `source_image_id` - (Optional) **(when copying an OMI)** The ID of the OMI you want to copy.
* `source_region_name` - (Optional) **(when copying an OMI)** The name of the source Region (always the same as the Region of your account).
* `tags` - (Optional) A tag to add to this resource. You can specify this argument several times.
    * `key` - (Required) The key of the tag, with a minimum of 1 character.
    * `value` - (Required) The value of the tag, between 0 and 255 characters.
* `vm_id` - (Optional) **(when creating from a VM)** The ID of the VM from which you want to create the OMI.
