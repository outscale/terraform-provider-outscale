# outscale_security_group Resource

Manages a security group.

Security groups you create to use in a Net contain a default outbound rule that allows all outbound flows.

For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Security-Groups.html).  
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-securitygroup).

## Example Usage

### Optional resource

```hcl
resource "outscale_net" "net01" {
	ip_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

### Create a security group for a Net

```hcl
resource "outscale_security_group" "security_group01" {
	description         = "Terraform security group"
	security_group_name = "terraform-security-group"
	net_id              = outscale_net.net01.net_id
}
```

### Create a security group for a Net without the default outbound rule 

```hcl
resource "outscale_security_group" "security_group02" {
    remove_default_outbound_rule = true
    description                  = "Terraform security group without outbound rule"
    security_group_name          = "terraform-security-group-empty"
    net_id                       = outscale_net.net01.net_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Required) A description for the security group.<br />
This description can contain between 1 and 255 characters. Allowed characters are `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, accented letters, spaces, and `_.-:/()#,@[]+=&;{}!$*`.
* `net_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Net for the security group.
* `remove_default_outbound_rule` - (Optional) (Net only) By default or if set to false, the security group is created with a default outbound rule allowing all outbound flows. If set to true, the security group is created without a default outbound rule. For an existing security group, setting this parameter to true deletes the security group and creates a new one.
* `security_group_name` - (Required) The name of the security group.<br />
This name must not start with `sg-`.<br />
This name must be unique and contain between 1 and 255 characters. Allowed characters are `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, spaces, and `_.-:/()#,@[]+=&;{}!$*`.
* `tags` - (Optional) A tag to add to this resource. You can specify this argument several times.
    * `key` - (Required) The key of the tag, with a minimum of 1 character.
    * `value` - (Required) The value of the tag, between 0 and 255 characters.
