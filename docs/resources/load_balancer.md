# outscale_load_balancer Resource

Manages a load balancer.

For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Load-Balancers.html).  
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-loadbalancer).

## Example Usage

### Create a load balancer in the public Cloud

```hcl
resource "outscale_load_balancer" "load_balancer01" {
    load_balancer_name = "terraform-public-load-balancer"
    subregion_names    = ["${var.region}a"]
    listeners {
        backend_port           = 8080
        backend_protocol       = "HTTP"
        load_balancer_protocol = "HTTP"
        load_balancer_port     = 8080
    }
    tags {
        key   = "name"
        value = "terraform-public-load-balancer"
    }
}
```
