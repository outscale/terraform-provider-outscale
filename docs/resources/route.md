## Example Usage

### Required resources

```hcl
resource "outscale_net" "net01" {
	ip_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "outscale_route_table" "route_table01" {
	net_id = outscale_net.net01.net_id
}

resource "outscale_internet_service" "internet_service01" {
}

resource "outscale_internet_service_link" "internet_service_link01" {
	internet_service_id = outscale_internet_service.internet_service01.internet_service_id
	net_id              = outscale_net.net01.net_id
}
```

### Create a route to an Internet service

```hcl
resource "outscale_route" "route01" {
	gateway_id           = outscale_internet_service.internet_service01.internet_service_id
	destination_ip_range = "0.0.0.0/0"
	route_table_id       = outscale_route_table.route_table01.route_table_id
}
```

The following arguments are supported:

* `await_active_state` - (Optional) By default or if set to true, waits for the route to be in the `active` state to declare its successful creation.<br />If false, the created route is in the `active` state if available, or the `blackhole` state if not available.
* `destination_ip_range` - (Required) The IP range used for the destination match, in CIDR notation (for example, `10.0.0.0/24`).
* `gateway_id` - (Optional) The ID of an Internet service or virtual gateway attached to your Net.
* `nat_service_id` - (Optional) The ID of a NAT service.
* `net_peering_id` - (Optional) The ID of a Net peering.
* `nic_id` - (Optional) The ID of a NIC.
* `route_table_id` - (Required) The ID of the route table for which you want to create a route.
* `vm_id` - (Optional) The ID of a NAT VM in your Net (attached to exactly one NIC).

## Attribute Reference
