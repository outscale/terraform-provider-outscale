data "outscale_security_group" "security_group01" {
    filter {
        name   = "security_group_ids"
        values = ["sg-12345678"]
    }
}
```

    * `inbound_rule_security_group_names` - (Optional) The names of the security groups that have been granted permissions.
    * `inbound_rule_to_port_ranges` - (Optional) The ends of the port ranges for the TCP and UDP protocols, or the ICMP code numbers.
    * `net_ids` - (Optional) The IDs of the Nets specified when the security groups were created.
    * `outbound_rule_account_ids` - (Optional) The account IDs that have been granted permissions.
    * `outbound_rule_from_port_ranges` - (Optional) The beginnings of the port ranges for the TCP and UDP protocols, or the ICMP type numbers.
    * `outbound_rule_ip_ranges` - (Optional) The IP ranges that have been granted permissions, in CIDR notation (for example, `10.0.0.0/24`).

    * `security_group_names` - (Optional) The names of the security groups.
    * `tag_keys` - (Optional) The keys of the tags associated with the security groups.
    * `tag_values` - (Optional) The values of the tags associated with the security groups.
