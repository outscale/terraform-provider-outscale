      You can also use this method to copy an OMI to your account, from an account in the same Region. To do so, the owner of the source OMI must share it with your account. For more information about how to share an OMI with another account in the same Region, see [UpdateImage](#updateimage).<br />

      To copy an OMI between accounts in different Regions, the owner of the source OMI must first export it to an Object Storage Unit (OSU) bucket using the [CreateImageExportTask](#createimageexporttask) method, and then you need to create a copy of the image in your account.<br />

      The copy of the source OMI is independent and belongs to you.<br /><br />


      You can also use this method to register an OMI to finalize its creation process.<br />

      You can register an OMI from a snapshot of a root device to create an OMI based on this snapshot. You can also register an OMI that has been exported to an OSU bucket to create a copy of it in your account. For more information about OMI export to an OSU bucket, see [CreateImageExportTask](#createimageexporttask).<br />

      You can register an OMI using a pre-signed URL of the manifest file of the OMI. You do not need any permission for this OMI, or the bucket in which it is contained. The manifest file is obsolete seven days after a completed export as it contains pre-signed URLs to the appropriate snapshots (pre-signed URLs are valid for only seven days).<br />

      Once the OMI is registered, you can launch a VM from this OMI. The copy of the source OMI is independent and belongs to you.'

      You can also use this method to copy a snapshot to your account, from an account in the same Region.<br />

      By default, the EIP is disassociated every time you stop and start the VM. For a persistent association, you can add the `osc.fcu.eip.auto-attach` tag to the VM with the EIP as value. For more information, see the [CreateTags](#createtags) method.<br /><br />


      **[NOTE]**<br />

      You can associate an EIP with a network address translation (NAT) service only when creating the NAT service. To modify its EIP, you need to delete the NAT service and re-create it with the new EIP. For more information, see the [CreateNatService](#createnatservice) method.'
