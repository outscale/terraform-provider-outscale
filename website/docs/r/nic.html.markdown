# outscale_nic Resource

Manages a network interface card (NIC).
For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-FNIs.html).
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-nic).

## Example Usage

### Required resources

```hcl
resource "outscale_net" "net01" {
  ip_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "outscale_subnet" "subnet01" {
  subregion_name = "eu-west-2a"
  ip_range       = "10.0.0.0/18"
  net_id         = outscale_net.net01.net_id
}

resource "outscale_security_group" "security_group01" {
  description         = "Terraform security group for nic with private IPs"
  security_group_name = "terraform-security-group-nic-ips"
  net_id              = outscale_net.net01.net_id
}
```

### Create a NIC

```hcl
resource "outscale_nic" "nic01" {
  subnet_id = outscale_subnet.subnet01.subnet_id
}

```

### Create a NIC with private IP addresses

```hcl
resource "outscale_nic" "nic02" {
  description       = "Terraform nic with private IPs"
  subnet_id         = outscale_subnet.outscale_subnet01.subnet_id
  security_group_ids = [outscale_security_group.outscale_security_group1.security_group_id]
  private_ips {
    is_primary = true
    private_ip = "10.0.0.1"
  }
  private_ips {
    is_primary = false
    private_ip = "10.0.0.2"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Optional) A description for the NIC.
* `private_ips` - (Optional) The primary private IP for the NIC.<br />
This IP must be within the IP range of the Subnet that you specify with the `subnet_id` attribute.<br />
If you do not specify this attribute, a random private IP is selected within the IP range of the Subnet.
    * `is_primary` - (Optional) If true, the IP is the primary private IP of the NIC.
    * `private_ip` - (Optional) The private IP of the NIC.
* `security_group_ids` - (Optional) One or more IDs of security groups for the NIC.
* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the Subnet in which you want to create the NIC.
* `tags` - (Optional) A tag to add to this resource. You can specify this argument several times.
    * `key` - (Required) The key of the tag, with a minimum of 1 character.
    * `value` - (Required) The value of the tag, between 0 and 255 characters.

* `description` - The description of the NIC.
* `is_source_dest_checked` - (Net only) If true, the source/destination check is enabled. If false, it is disabled. This value must be false for a NAT VM to perform network address translation (NAT) in a Net.
* `link_nic` - Information about the NIC attachment.
    * `delete_on_vm_deletion` - If true, the NIC is deleted when the VM is terminated.

    * `link_nic_id` - The ID of the NIC to attach.
    * `state` - The state of the attachment (`attaching` \| `attached` \| `detaching` \| `detached`).
    * `vm_account_id` - The account ID of the owner of the VM.
    * `vm_id` - The ID of the VM.
* `link_public_ip` - Information about the public IP association.
    * `link_public_ip_id` - (Required in a Net) The ID representing the association of the public IP with the VM or the NIC.
    * `public_dns_name` - The name of the public DNS.
    * `public_ip` - The public IP associated with the NIC.
    * `public_ip_account_id` - The account ID of the owner of the public IP.
    * `public_ip_id` - The allocation ID of the public IP.
* `mac_address` - The Media Access Control (MAC) address of the NIC.
