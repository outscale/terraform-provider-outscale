# outscale_image Resource

Manages an image.
For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-OMIs.html).
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-image).

## Example Usage

### Create an image

```hcl
resource "outscale_image" "image01" {
  image_name = "terraform-omi-create"
  vm_id      = var.vm_id
  no_reboot  = "true"
}
```

### Import an image
~> **Important** Make sure the manifest file is still valid.

```hcl
resource "outscale_image" "image02" {
  description   = "Terraform register OMI"
  image_name    = "terraform-omi-register"
  file_location = "<URL>"
}
```

### Copy an image

```hcl
resource "outscale_image" "image03" {
  description        = "Terraform copy OMI"
  image_name         = "terraform-omi-copy"
  source_image_id    = "ami-12345678"
  source_region_name = "eu-west-2"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `architecture` - (Optional) The architecture of the OMI (by default, `i386`).
* `block_device_mappings` - (Optional) One or more block device mappings.
    * `bsu` - Information about the BSU volume to create.
        * `delete_on_vm_deletion` - (Optional) By default or if set to true, the volume is deleted when terminating the VM. If false, the volume is not deleted when terminating the VM.
        * `iops` - (Optional) The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). This parameter must be specified only if you create an `io1` volume. The maximum number of IOPS allowed for `io1` volumes is `13000`.
        * `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The ID of the snapshot used to create the volume.
        * `volume_size` - (Optional) The size of the volume, in gibibytes (GiB).<br />
If you specify a snapshot ID, the volume size must be at least equal to the snapshot size.<br />
If you specify a snapshot ID but no volume size, the volume is created with a size similar to the snapshot one.
        * `volume_type` - (Optional) The type of the volume (`standard` \| `io1` \| `gp2`). If not specified in the request, a `standard` volume is created.<br />
For more information about volume types, see [About Volumes > Volume Types and IOPS](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Volumes.html#_volume_types_and_iops).
    * `device_name` - (Optional) The name of the device.
    * `virtual_device_name` - (Optional) The name of the virtual device (ephemeralN).
* `description` - (Optional) A description for the new OMI.
* `file_location` - (Optional) The pre-signed URL of the OMI manifest file, or the full path to the OMI stored in a bucket. If you specify this parameter, a copy of the OMI is created in your account.
* `image_name` - (Optional) A unique name for the new OMI.<br />
Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), spaces ( ), parentheses (()), slashes (/), periods (.), or dashes (-).
* `no_reboot` - (Optional) If false, the VM shuts down before creating the OMI and then reboots. If true, the VM does not.
* `root_device_name` - (Optional) The name of the root device.
* `source_image_id` - (Optional) The ID of the OMI you want to copy.
* `source_region_name` - (Optional) The name of the source Region, which must be the same as the Region of your account.
* `tags` - (Optional) A tag to add to this resource. You can specify this argument several times.
    * `key` - (Required) The key of the tag, with a minimum of 1 character.
    * `value` - (Required) The value of the tag, between 0 and 255 characters.
* `vm_id` - (Optional) The ID of the VM from which you want to create the OMI.
