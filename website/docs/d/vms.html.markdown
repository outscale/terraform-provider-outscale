For more information on this resource, see the [User Guide](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-Instances.html).
For more information on this resource actions, see the [API documentation](https://docs.outscale.com/api#3ds-outscale-api-vm).

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "outscale_vms" "vms_01" {
  filter {
    name   = "vm_ids"
    values = ["i-12345678", "i-12345679"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `filter` - (Optional) A combination of a filter name and one or more filter values. You can specify this argument for as many filter names as you need. The filter name can be any of the following:
    * `tag_keys` - (Optional) The keys of the tags associated with the VMs.
    * `tag_values` - (Optional) The values of the tags associated with the VMs.
    * `tags` - (Optional) The key/value combination of the tags associated with the VMs, in the following format: &quot;Filters&quot;:{&quot;Tags&quot;:[&quot;TAGKEY=TAGVALUE&quot;]}.
